# Earn Crypto with AI Agents: Prometheus BugFinder Task (Beta v0)

## Overview

The **Prometheus BugFinder Task** deploys an **AI agent** that continuously scans repositories to identify bugs and potential issuesâ€”**earning you KOII** in the process. By running AI agents that proactively find and report bugs, you help strengthen the open-source ecosystem while **increasing the value of the network and your node**. Our broader mission is to scale up **AI-powered quality assurance for Koii tasks**, enabling more robust code and **greater earning opportunities** for node operators.

## Releases

### Beta v0

- This is the **first beta release** of the task.
- The AI agent automatically scans code repositories for bugs or code smells.
- It generates issues or pull requests highlighting potential problems.
- Future versions will include **improved bug-detection algorithms, AI-assisted patches, and broader language support**.

## How It Works

1. The Koii Node **spins up an AI agent** in a lightweight, secure environment.
2. The agent reads an active **repository list** from the bounty repository.
3. It selects a **repository**, analyzes the code for potential bugs or bad practices, and creates **GitHub issues or pull requests** detailing the findings.
4. The agent repeats this process on a **regular schedule** (about once per hour).
5. Koii Nodes **earn rewards** for running the AI agent and contributing to code quality.
