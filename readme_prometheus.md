# Bug Finder: Prometheus Development Project

## Project Overview

Prometheus is an early-stage software development project focused on creating a robust, modular system for identifying and analyzing software bugs. The project aims to develop a comprehensive bug detection and reporting framework that can be integrated into various software development workflows.

### Key Objectives
- Create a modular, scalable bug detection system
- Develop flexible microservices architecture
- Provide actionable insights into software quality and potential issues

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Under Active Development**
- Basic project structure established
- Initial architectural planning in progress
- Core components being designed and prototyped

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Development environment with modern programming tools
- Version control system (Git)
- Basic understanding of software development methodologies

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/bug-finder.git
   cd bug-finder
   ```

2. Explore the project structure
   ```
   .
   â”œâ”€â”€ planner/        # Strategic planning and design components
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ placeholder.txt
   â””â”€â”€ worker/         # Core implementation and processing logic
       â””â”€â”€ placeholder.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into modular components to support a flexible and extensible architecture:

- `planner/`: Contains strategic planning modules and design specifications
- `worker/`: Hosts core implementation and processing logic for bug detection

## Planned Technologies & Architecture

### Anticipated Technology Stack
- Microservices architecture
- Scalable and distributed computing principles
- Language-agnostic bug detection mechanisms

### Potential Technologies
- Containerization (Docker)
- Distributed computing frameworks
- Machine learning for intelligent bug analysis
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring systems

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Basic directory structure
- [ ] Define core architectural patterns
- [ ] Develop initial microservice blueprints

### Phase 2: Core Development
- [ ] Implement initial bug detection mechanisms
- [ ] Create modular service interfaces
- [ ] Develop robust error tracking system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Machine learning integration
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Advanced reporting and visualization
